# data product: lending app

In this project, we will builds an on-demand, cloud-based, and highly scalable app that predicts consumer loan interest rates. The interest rates ranges from 5 to 26 percent. Yet, on average, the model predicted the interest rates to within 0.19 percent.  

The project demonstrates an end-to-end data product lifecycle starting from data analysis, model training, to deployment. The aim of the project is to show that building a viable data product is attainable while accelerating time to market.
